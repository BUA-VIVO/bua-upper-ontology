## BUA UPPER ONTOLOGY

The BUA Upper Ontology is an upper ontology expressing topics in the German Academic and Academic Administrative domain, intended intitially for the Berliner University Aliance to ensure  a consequent common model for the alliance as well as to give each member the freedom to express local idiosynchrasies

The Ontology suclasses and extends mainly the main ontology underlying VIVO, an open source semantic web tool for research discovery [vivo-project /
VIVO] (https://github.com/vivo-project/VIVO), as well as the HerculesCRUE / ROH Academic Domain Ontology 
[HerculesCRUE / ROH ](https://github.com/HerculesCRUE/ROH), and tries to harmonize them for use in VIVO
